CASPAROV: Computer Algebra System using Reverse Polish Notation

Computer Algebra System and Reverse Polish Notation, two terms that predates the birth of most programmers today.

John Harrison's HOL Light https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/ provides easy to follow instructions into the world of computer algebra system (CAS).

Reddit /r/Forth and Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.forth are the most active forums for the Forth programming language, the premier implementation of the reverse Polish nation (RPN) for over five decades. 

While Godot and Blender introduce most young programmers to the significance of algebraic equations in games and animation, few would venture into the niche field of computer algebra system, perhaps the pinnacle of programming and mathematics, the next level up from developing programming languages.

CASPAROV is here to fill the gap, combining the demand of ivory towers for CAS and the ease of use of RPN, as easy as the once legendary, but disappearing HP RPN calculators.

You may wonder, how is that possible? This is perhaps one of the most mysterious truth in human history, whose answer awaits exploration.

Perhaps the less demanding introduction to CAS would be Python Sympy. Yet, readers may judge for themselves the learning curve required to get into it.

CASPAROV is able to break down CAS to simple steps like the commutative, associative and distributive laws, which will serve as our introduction.
